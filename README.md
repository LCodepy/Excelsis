# Excelsis

Excelsis is an esoteric programming language made in Python with an in-built IDE.
It is similar to Basic but is written on an infinite grid.

# Dependencies

In order to use Excelsis you need to have **pygame** library installed on your machine.
You can install pygame by opening the cmd and writing the following command:
```
$ pip install pygame
```

# How to get started

When you open the IDE by double-clicking on **launcher.py** file, a terminal will open. It will ask you to input a path
to the file you want to edit. ExcelsisIDE only excepts files that end with **.pkl** and have been created by the
ExcelsisIDE.
